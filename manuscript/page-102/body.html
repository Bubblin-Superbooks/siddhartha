No, I shall not lose a single drop of sweetness from your mouth, nor you from mine! So it is settled: Siddhartha will return, once he'll have what he still lacks: clothes, shoes, money. But speak, lovely Kamala, couldn't you still give me one small advice?"</p><p>"An advice? Why not? Who wouldn't like to give an advice to a poor, ignorant Samana, who is coming from the jackals of the forest?"</p><p>"Dear Kamala, thus advise me where I should go to, that I'll find these three things most quickly?"</p><p>"Friend, many would like to know this. You must do what you've learned and ask for money, clothes, and shoes in return. There is no other way for a poor man to obtain money. What might you be able to do?"</p><p>"I can think. I can wait. I can fast."</p><p>"Nothing else?"</p></div> </div>
