But he wouldn't take anything from another person for nothing; he would give his merchandise in return."</p><p>"So it seems to be indeed. Everyone takes, everyone gives, such is life."</p><p>"But if you don't mind me asking: being without possessions, what would you like to give?"</p><p>"Everyone gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the teacher teachings, the farmer rice, the fisher fish."</p><p>"Yes indeed. And what is it now what you've got to give? What is it that you've learned, what you're able to do?"</p></div> </div>
