His life had indeed been strange. And now, so it seemed, now he had really become a childlike person.</p><p>Siddhartha thought about his situation. Thinking was hard on him, he did not really feel like it, but he forced himself.</p><p>Now, he thought, since all these most easily perishing things have slipped from me again, now I'm standing here under the sun again just as I have been standing here a little child, nothing is mine, I have no abilities, there is nothing I could bring about, I have learned nothing. How wondrous is this! Now, that I'm no longer young, that my hair is already half gray, that my strength is fading, now I'm starting again at the beginning and as a child! Again, he had to smile.</p></div> </div>
