<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No, this is over, I have awakened, I have indeed awakened and have not been born before this very day."</p><p>In thinking this thoughts, Siddhartha stopped once again, suddenly, as if there was a snake lying in front of him on the path.</p><p>Because suddenly, he had also become aware of this: He, who was indeed like someone who had just woken up or like a new-born baby, he had to start his life anew and start again at the very beginning. When he had left in this very morning from the grove Jetavana, the grove of that exalted one, already awakening, already on the path towards himself, he had every intention, regarded as natural and took for granted, that he, after years as an ascetic, would return to his home and his father.</p></div> </div>
