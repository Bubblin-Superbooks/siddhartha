I'm repeating it: I wish that you would go this path up to its end, that you shall find salvation!"</p><p>In this moment, Govinda realized that his friend had left him, and he started to weep.</p><p>"Siddhartha!" he exclaimed lamentingly.</p><p>Siddhartha kindly spoke to him: "Don't forget, Govinda, that you are now one of the Samanas of the Buddha! You have renounced your home and your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced your free will, renounced all friendship. This is what the teachings require, this is what the exalted one wants. This is what you wanted for yourself. Tomorrow, oh Govinda, I'll leave you."</p></div> </div>
