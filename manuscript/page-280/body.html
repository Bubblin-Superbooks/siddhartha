But, oh Govinda, you did not recognise the sleeping man."</p><p>Astonished, as if he had been the object of a magic spell, the monk looked into the ferryman's eyes.</p><p>"Are you Siddhartha?" he asked with a timid voice. "I wouldn't have recognised you this time as well! From my heart, I'm greeting you, Siddhartha; from my heart, I'm happy to see you once again! You've changed a lot, my friend.&mdash;And so you've now become a ferryman?"</p></div> </div>
