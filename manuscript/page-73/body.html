<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Whether it may be good or bad, whether living according to it would be suffering or joy, I do not wish to discuss, possibly this is not essential&mdash;but the uniformity of the world, that everything which happens is connected, that the great and the small things are all encompassed by the same forces of time, by the same law of causes, of coming into being and of dying, this is what shines brightly out of your exalted teachings, oh perfected one. But according to your very own teachings, this unity and necessary sequence of all things is nevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of unity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had not been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be proven: these are your teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation.</p></div> </div>
