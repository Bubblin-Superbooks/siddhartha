Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal. You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are directly in front of your eyes."</p><p>"I don't quite understand yet," asked Govinda, "what do you mean by this?"</p></div> </div>
